# DiceGameWithSQL

Description


This is your final project, a 100% API designed by you where you will apply everything you know so far to create a complete application, from database to security. Apply everything you know even what is not asked.

Level 1

The dice game is played with two dice. In case the result of the sum of the two dice is 7, the game is won, otherwise it is lost. A player can see a list of all the rolls he has made and the success rate.

In order to play the game and make a roll, a user must register with a non-repeated name. When created, it is assigned a unique numeric identifier and a registration date. If the user so wishes, you may not add any name and it will be called "ANONYMOUS". There can be more than one "ANONYMOUS" player.

Each player can see a list of all the rolls they have made, with the value of each dice and whether or not the game has been won. In addition, you can know your success rate for all the rolls you have made.

You can't delete a particular game, but you can delete the entire list of rolls per player.

The software should be able to list all the players in the system, the success rate of each player and the average success rate of all the players in the system.

The software must respect the main design patterns.
